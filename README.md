# LLM_Course_HG
This is my repository for my code from the LLM Course by Hugging Face 

Why did I create this repository?
It's a seed I'm planting at the time of creating it. It's going to serve as my learning ground on building NLP models and working with LLMs mainly in Hugging Face. It also
serves as my starting mark in my journey in the tech world.

Background in a nutshell
So at the time of creation, I am a 19 y/o high school graduate on a forced gap year due to my failure of basically being rejected by every university I applied and when I got 
accepeted after making an apeal and being put in an alternative programme I wasn't able to register in time. Obviously it was very difficult to accept at first but through God 
I regained my strength and sought a different path. This let me to the world of AI firstly as a means to make money but it is slowly becoming a means for me to maximise my 
creative without it being valued by a mark on a rubric. 

Vision 
I want to be able to look back on this repository and see how far I've come. I also want people who are in similar shoes as me to be able to use it as a sort of guide that 
they can use to create and start their own journey in working with AI or coding in general. The goal is to get as good as possible so much so I don't have to go to university.
My purpose is not to make school projects/ assignments but to actually build stuff that be able to hold up in the real world.

Extras
I did IT in high school and I didn't enjoy the coding as much at the time, probably because it wasn't as flexible as I wanted. So I left high school with not really a 
significant mark but atleast a pass.
